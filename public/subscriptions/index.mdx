> A simple subscription app to regularly receive books

### Introduction

This was a mobile application that we built in ACES that provided an easy way for the regular person, to subscribe and receive books regularly. We used Vue to build an Single Page Application, and the navigation is done through state management and component rendering. Then we converted it into a Progressive Web Application, so it could be installed on mobile.

Vue for the frontend, most of the backend was connected to the same .NET API, that Commerce was connected to, we just had to make a few new features for Authentication. And of course TailwindCSS was the choice, since styling is similar to other products developed in ACES.
