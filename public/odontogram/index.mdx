# Be Neutral

> Awesome application for dentists

### Introduction

This application was developed for odontology students at a university, they had the need to store procedure-based data that usually was just drawn on paper. The challenge was drawing an interface, that would allow them to select each tooth, and the correct side of it, to save procedures that were done, or schedule to be done.

### Stack description

<TagMap tags={['vue','js','node','msql']} />

For this application we chose to use Vue, and also the component library Vuetify,
so that main UI was quickly done, and we could focus specifically on the odontogram.
This problem was solved using W3 a tool that allowed me to create all the teeth recursively,
but keeping track of the unique identifiers.
