### Introduction

Case History is a medical record keeper, exclusively built for self-managed physicians that one to keep everything in one place, with a minimalistic approach. Some of the features offered are, patient management, issue oriented case history for each patient, and calendar / scheduler. Another highlight is that the medic, can only complete indispensable information, and only adding when required, with a special on-demand component list (and according to specialization).

For this project I used NextJS, taking advantage of some SSR pages and others staticly
served. For styling I used ChackaUI, a React based component library that allowed
for a fast building of highly interactive components. I hooked it all up with Mongo
for a database, a document oriented solution that easily handles the case histories,
no matter how big they get. I relied on the API folder that next provides, to write
some Authentication code, and write the PUT and POST methods to save the data, there
was little to no need of writing GETs since I worked with SSR pages.
