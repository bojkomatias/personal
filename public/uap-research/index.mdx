We used NextJS to take advantage of SSR and dynamic pages. And built some flexible React components that could interact with the process of creating a protocol, but later on, also the evaluation process. To prevent compatibility issues we dockerized the application, and also the Mongo database, where all the documents are stored. And Tailwind was our go to solution for building the UI.
