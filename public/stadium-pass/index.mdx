# Stadium Pass

> An NFT minting page

### Introduction

An NFT project, that needed mostly marketing and later on a site to mint the product by interacting with Solidity contracts. It consists in a freshly animated and attractive landing page. Amilcar was in charge of writing the Solidity code.

### Stack description

<TagMap tags={['react','node','tailwind','sol','js']} />


I developed the project in NextJS, with Tailwind for most of the UI. Also used GSAP to handle animations and provide a good UX. The project included a ETH wallet connection in the website, but later on the NFT product never saw the light of day (as many projects do)
