# Commerce

> Commerce site for an publishing house

### Introduction

I worked in this project as the Frontend Engineer with the team from ACES (Casa Editora Sudamericana). Consists on a big organization manager for ordering books, specially in bulk, from schools and churches directly to ACES (this was previously managed by people through email). Now sales go through directly, with some supervising from admins at different levels that monitor each task.

This project was built with Nuxt, that is a big framework with built in solutions
for scalable projects written in Vue. We had to code multiple middleware layers to
grant access, to specific features of the application. For a backend, we built a
full blown API in .NET framework. This API served the frontend a bunch of information
in multiple shapes, while also connecting it to internal systems from ACES. TailwindCSS
was also the choice for styling the site.
