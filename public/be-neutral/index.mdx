# Be Neutral

> Cero carbon emission project

### Introduction

Be Neutral was a project made with the intent of participating in a cero carbon emission project expose. The crew of the project from Chile, contacted Nico and me to develop a nice landing page and a carbon emission calculator for the individual person and for enterprises. The main challenge was the big calculator since the questions were extensive, and there was math involved.

### Stack description

<TagMap tags={['next','typescript','tailwind']} />

We used NextJS with Typescript for safe type checking since this was a multiple man
operation. And decided to style it with TailwindCSS, a wonderful technology to write
CSS and not repeat yourself coding, since many pages shared components or similar
styles. We hooked the data saving part of the project through de API folder to a
Supabase project, a simple SQL database open source solution
